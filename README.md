=============

This Repo contains my solutions to the problems found at www.projecteuler.com.

*WARNING* This repo contains my solutions and is intended for personal use. You are more than
welcome to look at my solutions however if you intend to solve the problems on your own I would highly
advise you to NOT look at my solutions until after you have completed each problem yourself. The fun is in
discovering solutions on your own. */WARNING*

Project Euler is a website that contains a series of math problems that would be
difficult to solve on your own without the use of a script. The purpose of the site
is to provide programmers with a opportunity to solve problems with the programming language
of their choice. The problems can be solved in a variety of ways and each exercise helps to build
logical and critical thinking skills.

I highly reconmend checking out Project Euler if you are interested in expanding your problem solving 
abilities.
